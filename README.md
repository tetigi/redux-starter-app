# redux-starter-app

This repo contains the bare minimum implementation to do something that resembles
a (crappy) TODO app, without using any magical libs.

Our aim is going to be to convert this into an app that uses redux!

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tetigi/redux-starter-app
